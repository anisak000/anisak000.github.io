Astronomer (Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Exoplanetary Microlensing)
Smithsonianan Astrophysical Observatory, MA

Comment: Given the later deadline (2022), I might work on this more in January after AAS... Looks like an exciting fellowship on microlensing detection of planets and seems like they're willing to train the incoming postdoc but may need to call and ask to confirm what they are looking for. Don't have much experience with microlensing (I did however give a seminar presentation on detecting rogue planets from dynamical scattering using microlensing) but am open to learning more.
